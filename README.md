# SQL Tasks

## A) Marketing Analysis

1. **Loyal User Reward**

   - **Task**: Identify users who have never posted a single photo on Instagram.

3. **Contest Winner Declaration**  
   - **Objective**: The team has organized a contest where the user with the most likes on a single photo wins.
   - **Task**: Determine the winner of the contest and provide their details to the team.

4. **Hashtag Research**

## B) Investor Metrics

1. **User Engagement**  
   - **Objective**: Investors want to know if users are still active and posting on Instagram or if they are making fewer posts.
   - **Task**: Calculate the average number of posts per user on Instagram. Also, provide the total number of photos on Instagram divided by the total number of users.

2. **Bots & Fake Accounts**  
   - **Objective**: Investors want to know if the platform is crowded with fake and dummy accounts.
   - **Task**: Identify users (potential bots) who have liked every single photo on the site, as this is not typically possible for a normal user.
