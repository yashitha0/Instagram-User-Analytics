# Project Overview

In this project, you are a data analyst working with the product team at Instagram. Your primary responsibility is to analyze user interactions and engagement within the Instagram app, providing insights that drive business growth.

User analysis involves tracking how users interact with digital products, such as a mobile app, to uncover patterns and trends. Insights from this analysis can guide various teams within the organization: the marketing team may leverage these insights to launch targeted campaigns, the product team might use them to prioritize new feature development, and the development team could apply them to enhance user experience.

Using SQL and MySQL Workbench, you will analyze Instagram user data to address specific questions posed by the management team. Your insights will enable the product manager and the team to make data-driven decisions that shape the app's future direction.

**Objective**: The goal is to apply SQL to extract actionable insights from user data. Your findings have the potential to impact future developments of one of the worldâ€™s most popular social media platforms.
